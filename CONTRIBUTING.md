## `CONTRIBUTING` ##

Thanks for wanting to contribute to this repo. In order to make the review
process simpler and easier, please do the following before submitting a pull
request:

* Make sure your patch is based off `master` (or at the least, it applies
  cleanly on `master`). If you just created a new branch from `master` this
  will already be true.

* Include a `Signed-off-by:` line in your commit message. This can be done in
  `git commit` with the `-s` flag. The meaning of this line is the same as in
  the Linux kernel and various other free software projects, and is effectively
  you "signing" the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).

Thanks!
